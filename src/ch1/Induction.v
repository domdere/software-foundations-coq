(* [Case] is not built into Coq: we need to define it ourselves.
    There is no need to understand how it works -- you can just skip
    over the definition to the example that follows.  It uses some
    facilities of Coq that we have not discussed -- the string
    library (just for the concrete syntax of quoted strings) and the
    [Ltac] command, which allows us to declare custom tactics.  Kudos
    to Aaron Bohannon for this nice hack! *)
